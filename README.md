# INCS775
Generally speaking this task is not as easy as it looks.
we need a parameter k
for the first row, 
it is (k/2) power by 2, which is the core switches

and then it is the pots. k^k

so it has two layser, which is k^k/2 and k^k/2 
case k = 16

64 / 16 = 4
64 / 16 = 4

assume k sqrt is each port each layer's number 24
288 / 24 = 12
288 / 24 = 12 

each port each layer has 12

and then the servers which is (k^3)/4

3456  / 24 

each port 144

core (k/2) ^ 2, which means each core has k^2 / 4 * k = k / 4.
each port each layer has switches k/2
so each port is connecting server (k^2)/4
